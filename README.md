This project investigates the classification of mice into eight distinct experimental groups based on the expression levels of 77 proteins. The study involves two genetic types of mice: normal genotype (wild type) and trisomic mice (Ts65Dn), which model aspects of Down syndrome (DS). The trisomic mice exhibit learning impairments, particularly in context fear conditioning (CFC), a protocol that tests memory and learning. In this protocol, some mice (CS group) are exposed to a context-shock pairing, while others (SC group) receive a shock without the context association. Wild-type mice learn the association and freeze upon re-exposure to the context, but Ts65Dn mice typically do not unless treated with the drug memantine, which rescues their learning ability.

The eight groups of mice include both CS and SC groups for wild-type and trisomic mice, with and without memantine or saline injections, enabling comparison of learning outcomes and treatment effects across genetic types.

This project aims to classify the mice into these experimental categories based on patterns in protein expression, using the 77 protein levels as features. This classification could potentially help identify protein markers associated with genetic type, treatment response, and learning outcomes.
